// In computer science, bogosort is a particularly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. 
// The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted.
// It is not useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with other more realistic algorithms.
