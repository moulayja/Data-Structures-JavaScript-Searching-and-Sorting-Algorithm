// Cocktail shaker sort (also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort,
// ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort ) is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm
// and a comparison sort. The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through 
// the list. This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort,
// and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance improvements,
// and does not improve asymptotic performance; like the bubble sort, it is not of practical interest,
// though it finds some use in education.
