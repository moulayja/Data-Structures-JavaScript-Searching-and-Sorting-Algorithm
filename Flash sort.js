// Flashsort is a distribution sorting algorithm showing linear computational complexity O(n) for uniformly distributed 
// data sets and relatively little additional memory requirement.
// The original work was published in 1998 by Karl-Dietrich Neubert. 
// The basic idea behind flashsort is that in a data set with a known distribution,
// it is easy to immediately estimate where an element should be placed after sorting when the range of the set is known.
